([Nine-Men's game](https://github.com/yashikaadesai/Nine-Mens-Morris-Board-Game)) : Created a Python-based version of the Nine Mill board game, leveraging OOP principles for board management, piece placement, and player interactions. Integrated core functionalities like mill detection, piece movement, and turn-based mechanics for a dynamic gaming interface.
